# Micro webapp to search for bus trips for a fixed date, fixed locations

It does not have dynamic controls for selecting date, locations and other options.

For production app, I would use preprocessor and/or postprocessor like SASS/postCSS

Would have also added Cypress.io integration testing on top for most critical scenarios

Support with multiple languages would have been implemented with `react-i18next`
