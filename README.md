# Bus route ticket display system thing
My first experience using React.JS, ES6, and Webpack. A system to display bus tickets available between two locations for a specific date. Allows multiple system configurations, which are mapped by the hostname. Configurations can be stored locally, or on a config server. Anything uploaded to the system config is automatically live.

### Features
* React.js, Node.js, ES6ish.
* Localization support, including city names (Montreal vs Montr√©al), and dates
* Support for multiple systems via config payload, which is determined by the hostname
* Responsive!
* Countdown timer!
* Video?
* Bleeding edge things

### Sample systems
* http://osheaga.freshtapes.com
* http://bonnaroo.freshtapes.com
* http://yosemite.freshtapes.com
* http://pitchfork.freshtapes.com (warning: auto-plays with sound)
* http://heavymyl.freshtapes.com (warning: auto-plays with sound)
* http://wemf.freshtapes.com (warning: auto-plays with sound)

### Build instructions
* `gulp --debug` to build for development 
* `gulp` to build for production

### Server Configuration
* `server/config.js` holds the server side configuration, checks for ENVVARS and uses them insted, if found.
* `SYSTEMS_CONFIG_LOCATION` this can also be a local path, if remote system configs are not desired. Any URL where the files are available by http will work.

### System Configurations
`config.json` Allows configuration of a video splash, localization overrides, the geohash of the origin and destinations, and the event time and name.
```
{
  "origin" : {
    "geoHash": "dr5reg"
  },
  "destination" : {
    "geoHash": "dn6m9p"
  },
  "currency": "USD",
  "eventStartTime" : "2017-06-08T19:20:30+05:00",
  "departureDate" : "2017-06-07",
  "locales" : {
    "default" : {
      "ORIGIN_NAME" : "New York",
      "DESTINATION_NAME" : "Nashville",
      "EVENT_NAME" : "Bonnaroo"
    },
    "fr" : {
      "ORIGIN_NAME" : "La Grosse Pomme"
    }
  },
  "video" : {                        //optional override
    "muted" : false,                 //optional override
    "autoPlay" : false,              //optional override
    "src" : "systems/res/splash.mp4" //optional override
  },
  "style":                           //optional override
    {
      "background":{                 //optional override
        "src":"system/res/bkg.jpg"   //optional override
      },
      "logo":{                       //optional override
        "src":"system/res/logo.png"  //optional override
      }
    }
}
```
`styles.css` Allows overrides for all of the styles on the page, loads after primary stylesheet
```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Shadows+Into+Light');
body {
  background-color: #571178;
}
.tagLineBanner {
  font-family: 'Shadows Into Light', cursive;
}
header .logo {
  height: 325px; height: 32.5rem;
}
svg.icon {
  fill: #CCC !important;
}
```

Systems expect this structure, additional resources can be referenced by the css. (the server 302's to the actual resoruce)
```
/systems/hostname/config.json
                 /styles.css
                 /resource.png
```
### Todo
* Implement a real localization library
* Clean up server/index.js a bit, move the connection stuff into api.js
* Add config option to allow a system to be told which api endpoint to connect to. (Allow direct connection, supplying the token)
* Geolocate the user, and use this instead of the config's origin.
