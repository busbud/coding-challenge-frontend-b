# Osheagabud


This app meets all the base requirements, and is deployed at https://callum-busbud-demo.herokuapp.com/

I built the app entirely out of scratch with no boilerplate, as I really wanted to learn the ins and outs of react 
and es6. This approach ended up taking more time than anticipated but was an awesome learning experience.

I hope you like it!
