# Busbud - Osheaga Coding Challenge

It is my first app with ReactJS, it was pretty cool and very instructive even if the philosophy is completely different from Angular. I learnt a lot of things and I liked the easiness of the components implementation.
Unfortunately I was only able to do a few unit tests but it allowed me to implement additionnal testing libraries.
