Osheaga 2020 may have been postponed, but Montreal's lesser known Fauxsheaga is welcoming socially-distant music lovers from inside Canada's borders from September to the end of December. This micro site is a promotional page for the event in partnership with Busbud.

## Project details

This project was bootstrapped with `yarn create react-app` using the `--template typescript` option.

Deployment to Heroku was aided with buildpacks `heroku/nodejs` and `zidizei/heroku-buildpack-tsc`

## Thoughts

If I spent more time on this, I would

- add Redux. I am at the limit of comfort with prop-drilling.
- add more robust error handling
- add unit tests for services
