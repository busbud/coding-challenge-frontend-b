# Busbud Front-End Coding Challenge

Build from scratch without using any UI components.  
If you want me to build you a UI kit/components library you should look at this https://github.com/aminpaks/portfolio-reactjs.

Deployed: https://sample-challenge.herokuapp.com/

My notes: Tried to build it as simple as possible. Might not be the most clean code but this all we get for a couple of hours of work.
