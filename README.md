# Busbud Front-End Coding Challenge

Here's the coding challenge for Busbud. To be clear:

- The values shown on the Search page are hard-coded, so the values passed in to the service are also hard-coded except for the the language and the currency.
- Results are sorted by Departure time.

As requested, the application has been deployed to Heroku: [here is the link](https://shielded-spire-08850.herokuapp.com/)
