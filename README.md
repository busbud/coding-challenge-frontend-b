**This is the busbud front-end challenge**

Here is the site deployed on Heroku
__https://aqueous-temple-76875.herokuapp.com/__

Personally, this is a really exciting project :-) so first of all, thanks for giving me this opportunity. 

I officially started this project on last Saturday, so as of today, it took me 8 days. But due to the complication of my current job, I only got the weekends to work on it, last Saturday and this weekend. So in total I would say 3 days. Due to the fact that this is an interveiw project, i think it should be the time for me to submit the project. 

Til now,  the site is functional, meet the basic requirements, supprts currency change and with some responsive design layout. 

It was a great learning experience. I really appreciated it.

**Some personal thoughts**:

>Prior to this, I didn't have any experience in Node.js and React.js. My work experience is mainly involving Python and Backbone. However, i think, this project gave me the opportunity to let you guys see, within a short amount of time and with my experience and knowledge skills, i can pull this off. 

>Work has been creazy for me recently. After 2+ years of working as a dev, i don't really feel the joy of learning new things any more. But yesterday, it was the first time in a long time that I felt it again, my back was hurting after sitting all day in front of the computer but i was happy, actally i was excited that I finished something which was out of my knowledge scope a week ago. 


So again, thank you for giving me the chance :-D
