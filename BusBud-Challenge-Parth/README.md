# BusBudChallengeParth

### Note to Reviewers
Hello there,

Thanks for the opportunity! I've had a hectic week with school work kicking in rather quickly and so had basically just today to do something. And I really wanted to sustain my candidacy by doing the challenge - so here it is! It is a very basic application with the required features. I understand React is what Web Devs at BusBud prefer, and I really wanted to whip up something using that but with all the work this week, I just had to stick to what I'm confident in i.e. Angular. I will look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Parth
